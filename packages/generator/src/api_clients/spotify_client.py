"""
Spotify Web API Client
======================

Very thin wrapper around Spotifyâ€™s *Search* endpoint, used throughout
the benchmarking suite to verify that generated song titles actually
exist on the platform.

Only the functionality required for playlist-validation is implemented;
for anything more sophisticated consider using `spotipy`.
