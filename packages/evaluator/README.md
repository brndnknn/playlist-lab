# Playlist Evaluator

This is a Python project for evaluating music playlists generated by large language models in response to creative prompts.

The system assigns numeric scores to playlists based on:

* Prompt alignment
* Musical cohesion
* Cleverness and humor

It is intended for personal use, particularly in preparing training data to fine-tune a smaller LLM.
